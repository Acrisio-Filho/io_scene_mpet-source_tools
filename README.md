# io_scene_mpet - PangYa import script for Blender
This is a Work-In-Progress importer for importing PangYa models as Blender
scenes. It was developed through careful analysis of mpet files in a hex
editor. Currently, only some versions of mpet are supported, and not fully.
This will change shortly.

Special thanks to HSReina for their universal extractor and a few pointers.
Also, to the developers of the original paktools and mpetmqo tool.
